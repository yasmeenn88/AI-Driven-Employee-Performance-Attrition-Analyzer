##  Goal: Predicting Employee Attrition

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately **predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company** (Attrition = `Yes`) or stay (Attrition = `No`).

Understanding employee attrition allows HR teams to proactively address workplace issues, improve employee satisfaction, and reduce turnover costs.

Below is the class distribution of the target variable `Attrition`:

![Class Distribution](images/classes.jpg)

##  Categorical Feature Distribution by Attrition

To gain deeper insights into the factors influencing employee attrition, we examined the distribution of various **categorical features** across the two attrition classes (`Yes` and `No`).

The following plots show how different categories such as `Business_Travel`, `Department`, `Gender`, `Marital_Status`, and `Overtime` vary between employees who left the company and those who stayed:

- **Business Travel**: Employees who travel frequently or rarely show different attrition patterns.
- **Department**: Attrition rates vary across departments like Software Development, IT Services, and Cyber Security.
- **Gender**: Male and female employees exhibit similar attrition distributions.
- **Marital Status**: Single employees tend to have higher attrition than married ones.
- **Overtime**: Employees who work overtime are more likely to leave.

##  Outlier Detection in Numerical Features

To ensure data quality and model robustness, we analyzed the **numerical features** for outliers using **boxplots**.

The following features were checked:

- **Age**
- **Salary**
- **Salary_Hike_in_percent**

**Result:** No outliers were detected in any of these features, as all data points fall within the whiskers of the boxplots.

##  Correlation Matrix (Label Encoded Features)

To explore relationships between features, we generated a **correlation heatmap** using label-encoded data.

- **Observation:** Most features show **very weak or no correlation** with each other, including with the target variable `Attrition`.
- The matrix helps identify redundancy or multicollinearity among features before modeling.

> Color scale:
> - ðŸ”´ Red = Strong Positive Correlation
> - ðŸ”µ Blue = Weak/Negative Correlation
> - âšª White = No Correlation

##  Model Selection: Why We Chose Gradient Boosting

After evaluating several classification models, we selected **Gradient Boosting** as the final deployed model due to the following reasons:

- **Highest test accuracy** among all models (87.4%)
- **Best balance** between precision and recall for the minority class `Attrition = Yes`
- **Highest F1-score (Yes)**: Indicates better ability to detect actual attrition cases
- **No overfitting**: Unlike Decision Tree and Random Forest (which had 100% training accuracy), Gradient Boosting maintained good generalization
-  **Macro F1-score of 0.77**, showing strong overall performance across both classes

This makes Gradient Boosting the most reliable model for predicting employee attrition in a balanced and interpretable way.

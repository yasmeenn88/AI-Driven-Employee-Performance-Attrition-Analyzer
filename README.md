##  Goal: Predicting Employee Attrition

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately **predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company** (Attrition = `Yes`) or stay (Attrition = `No`).

Understanding employee attrition allows HR teams to proactively address workplace issues, improve employee satisfaction, and reduce turnover costs.

Below is the class distribution of the target variable `Attrition`:
